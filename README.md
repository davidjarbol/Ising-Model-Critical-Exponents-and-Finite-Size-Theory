# Ising-Model-Critical-Exponents-and-Finite-Size-Theory2
Project using the Metropolis algorithm to simulate spin dynamics in a 2D Ising model.

Language: Fortran 90

◦ Reviewed theory on the Ising model, Metropolis algorithm, and phase transitions.

◦ Simulated thermodynamic variables (magnetisation, susceptibility, energy, specific heat, etc.) as afunction of temperature for various system sizes.

◦ Determined the critical temperature and exponent.

◦ Analyzed finite-size effects in the system.

This is one of the two final projects of the course of Computational Physics in my BSc Physics at the University of Granada, Spain and, therefore, it is mainly in Spanish. 
An English version will be uploaded eventually.I will upload an English version eventually.
