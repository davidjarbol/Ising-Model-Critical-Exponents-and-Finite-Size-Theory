# Ising-Model-Critical-Exponents-and-Finite-Size-Theory2
Project using the Metropolis algorithm to simulate spin dynamics in a 2D Ising model.

Language: Fortran 90

◦ Reviewed theory on the Ising model, Metropolis algorithm, and phase transitions.

◦ Simulated thermodynamic variables (magnetisation, susceptibility, energy, specific heat, etc.) as afunction of temperature for various system sizes.

◦ Determined the critical temperature and exponent.

◦ Analyzed finite-size effects in the system.
